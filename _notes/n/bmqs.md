norman
- not a time for normal business
- want to remember the victims of epstein, want to talk about mandelson and epstein, a matter that far transcends party politics
- market-sensitive information to epstein
- described internal downing street memo as quote an interesting note
- the pm was specifically asked at pmqs yesterday if he knew that mandelson had continued his friendship with epstein after the conviction. he said and i quote when we drafted humble addresses in opposition, we always included an exemption for national security. unfortunately this is plainly untrue. i hope the leader would encourage the pm to correct the record on this point
- pm said mandelson lied to everyone about the depth and the extent of the relationship for years
- he knew mandelson had stayed in epstein mansion reported by public sources. pm had the public information further confirmed and reinforced by the security vetting that was done after the appointment but before he was assigned his contract of employment. a further chance and the pm ignored that too
- leader of libdems asked yesterday had he thought at all about epstein's victims. it is clear that the pm had not considered them at all or he could not have possibly taken the decision he did. so why did he, why did he choose mandelson? he did so because morgan mcsweeney told him.
- mcsweeney was mandelson's protégé, and mcsweeney was paying back his long time mentor and political sponsor
- incredible damage to the already fragile trust in politics
- every labour pm since 97 had given mandelson a senior job
- pm reputation destroyed by this scandal. entire political system harmed by it until effective measures are taken to clean it up
- Q1: can the leader give an undertaking that the documents to be provided to the intelligence and security would not be redacted?
- Q2: in order to reassure the house, can he asked the .. to review the appointment procedure undertaken in this case? and set out in writing why these failed to badly in this case and how they would be improved

campbell
- i thank the shadow leader of the house for the way in which he addressed these matters this morning, he is entitled to do so and i would go as far as to say he is right to do so, because i agree with him, there is palpable anger, there is sadness
- i am going to reverse the order, i am going to deal directly with the shadow leader first with his remarks because they are so important, and then with forgiveness and leave from you mr speaker i will make remarks about other matters
- humble address yesterday and the remarks of the pm. i think there is an assumption with humble addresses, i have drafted a few in my time, that national security matters would be exempted from these anyway, but as i think we found out yesterday there is a degree of confusion about that
- grateful that as the debate continued yesterday-- if it was imperfect at the beginning-- and i would say to him his motion was imperfect too- we got to the right place. in terrible circumstances a good moment for the house
- we need to make sure not only that there is a robust inquiry but that we trust people to get on with it
- it says they can ask for documents. and i hope we dont get to that but-- court-- so i wouldnt' recommend anybody to over redact documents. however painful it's going to be everything has to be out in that situation
- should have said at the beginning, i absolutely agree with the shadow leader not just how awful it is but we should never forget that it's the victims of epstein that we should have at the forefront of our deliberations
- pm made it absolutely clear that peter mandelson should not be a member of the house of lords, and although he has retired himself, we will be bringing forward legislation to strip him of his title
- pm agreed with the king that the former lord mandelson should be removed from the privy council
- the matter has been referred to the metropolitan police. they requested they be allowed to get on with the job
- pmqs was rightly dominated by these matters
- yesterday the not extraordinary but the unusual circumstances of 6 hours of debate on these matters
- we have listened and we are listening
- tribute to some people who died
- yesterday was national cancer day, we published national cancer plan. thousands of people will receive more timely treatment
- rollout of 500 new free breakfast clubs
- today is time to talk. break through the stigma of having conversations on mental health. children mental health
- members will also note, will interest i hope, that parliament restoration and renewal proposal report will be published by the house this afternoon. palace of westminster is part of a unesco world heritage site and is a symbol of our democracy. much need of significant work to maintain the building. take time to read the detailed report. in due course will bring the matter to debate and decision, not just by this house but by the house place too

[BMQs]

BMQs tracker of how many of Shadow LotH questions the LotH answers: **1/2 answered** (↓)

[Happened at 10:41](https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/4820c43b-f795-44de-9a35-13231242e863?in=10:41:29). [Hansard](https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2026-02-05/debates/BA6831CD-4FD9-46C7-B23A-503403ED4280/BusinessOfTheHouse).

*(Business Questions main exchange. `Q`s by Jesse Norman, answers by Alan Campbell. `REMARK`s are not questions and do not count for the tracker.)*

#### (1) 📜 REMARK: Market-sensitive information given to Epstein

> **NORMAN:** I do not think that this is a moment for normal business.

> [..] Peter Mandelson, when Business Secretary, advised Jeffrey Epstein that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of J. P. Morgan, should “mildly threaten” the Chancellor at the time—his colleague, Alistair Darling—over the planned tax on bankers’ bonuses, as Jamie Dimon, still the chief executive of J. P. Morgan, duly did.

> Mandelson forwarded market-sensitive information to Epstein that related to the 2009 sale of up to £20 billion in state assets, describing the internal Downing Street memo—internal, I stress—as an “Interesting note that’s gone to the PM.”

> Mandelson gave Epstein advance notice of the EU’s 2010 €500 billion bail-out the night before the official announcement, and he warned him in advance of the departure of Gordon Brown from No. 10 Downing Street—a further highly market-sensitive piece of information.

#### (2) 📜 REMARK: PM inadvertedly misled the House yesterday about Labour always including national security exemption in Humble Addresses

> **NORMAN:** In 2008, Jeffrey Epstein was convicted in Florida under a state plea bargain on two sample felony counts: solicitation of prostitution from a minor and procurement of a minor for prostitution. The Prime Minister was specifically asked at Prime Minister’s questions yesterday whether he knew that Mandelson had continued his friendship with Epstein after the conviction. He said: “when we drafted Humble Addresses in opposition, we always included an exemption for national security”.

> Unfortunately, that is plainly untrue—it must be inadvertent. When the Labour party presented its Humble Address for impact assessments on Brexit to be released on 1 November 2017, that address did not mention national security at all. The second name on that motion was that of the Prime Minister. I hope the Leader of the House will encourage the Prime Minister to correct the record when he next appears at the Dispatch Box.

> **CAMPBELL:** He talked about yesterday’s Humble Address and the remarks of the Prime Minister. I think there is an assumption with Humble Addresses—I have drafted a few in my time—that national security matters will be exempted from them, but as I think we found out yesterday, there is a degree of confusion about that.

#### (3) 📜 REMARK: The PM appointed Mandelson despite knowing about the relationship with Epstein because McSweeney told him to

> **NORMAN:** The Prime Minister also said yesterday: “we went through a process. There was a due diligence exercise, and then there was security vetting by the security services. What was not known was the sheer depth and the extent of the relationship. Mandelson lied about that to everyone for years.”

> Let us think about that for a moment. The Prime Minister is saying that if only he had known about the depth and the extent of the relationship between Mandelson and Epstein as it continued after 2008, he would have rejected the appointment. It was not enough that he knew Mandelson had a continuing relationship with this convicted paedophile and sex trafficker. He knew it—indeed, the fact that Mandelson had stayed in Epstein’s mansion had been reported to him by public sources, and he ignored it. Not only that, but the Prime Minister had the public information further confirmed and reinforced by the security vetting that was done after the appointment but before Mandelson had signed his contract of employment. That was a further chance for the Prime Minister to reject the appointment, and he ignored that too.

> The leader of the Liberal Democrats, the right hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Ed Davey), asked the Prime Minister yesterday: “can he tell us whether he thought at all about Epstein’s victims?”

> Those victims are the many dozens—perhaps hundreds—of girls and young women who were trafficked and abused by and through Jeffrey Epstein. It is clear that the Prime Minister did not consider them at all, or he could not have possibly taken the decision he did. So why did he choose Mandelson? Why did he take that decision? He did so because Morgan McSweeney told him to. McSweeney was Mandelson’s protégé, and McSweeney was paying back his long-time mentor and political sponsor for all those good works with his appointment.

→

> **CAMPBELL:** The shadow Leader of the House asks about the actions of the Prime Minister, and that will, of course, be part of the outcome of investigations and inquiries. We must ensure not simply that a robust inquiry is in place, but that we trust people to get on with it.

> [..] Let me say—I should also have said this at the beginning—that I absolutely agree with the shadow Leader of the House not just on how awful this is, but that the victims of Epstein should always be at the forefront in our deliberations. They are brave, and we must ensure that we rise to the challenge of ensuring that they get some kind of justice at the end of it all.

#### (4) 📜 REMARK: Incredible damage to our political system

> **NORMAN:** This whole episode has done incredible damage to the already fragile nature of trust in politics. Every Labour Prime Minister since 1997 has given Peter Mandelson a senior job and been betrayed by him. The present Prime Minister will be seen to have had his own reputation destroyed by this scandal. But let us be clear: every Member of this House and our entire political system have been harmed by it and will continue to be until effective measures are taken to clean it up.

#### (5) ✔️ Q1: Can he assure documents provided will not be redacted?

> **NORMAN:** Can the Leader of the House give an undertaking that the documents to be provided to the Intelligence and Security Committee will not be redacted?

→

> **CAMPBELL:** I expect the ISC to get whatever it asks for, and in the form in which it asks for it. It may have been missed yesterday, but the National Security Act 2023 states that the ISC can ask for documents. I hope we do not get to this situation, but if the ISC does not get those documents, it ends up in court with a judge deciding on such matters. I would not recommend anybody trying to over-redact or leave out documents, because I think we are in a situation where everything, however painful, needs to be out.

#### (6) ❌ Q2: Can he ask to review the appointment procedure taken in this case?

> **NORMAN:** In order to reassure the House, can he ask the Cabinet Secretary to review the appointment procedure undertaken in this case—both the public due diligence and the developed vetting process—and set out in writing why those failed so badly in this case and how they will be improved?

-----

#### ∗ ∗ ∗

> **CAMPBELL:** The Prime Minister has made it absolutely clear that Peter Mandelson should not be a Member of the House of Lords, and although Mandelson has himself retired, we will be bringing forward legislation to strip him of his title—as ever with these matters, it is slightly more difficult to achieve that than it is for me to say it from the Dispatch Box. The Prime Minister has agreed with the King that the former Lord Mandelson should be removed from the Privy Council. The matter has been referred to the Metropolitan police. They have requested that they be allowed to get on with the job, and I absolutely endorse that.

> Over this week we have had a statement from the Dispatch Box on these matters, then Prime Minister’s questions, which was rightly dominated by them, and yesterday we had the not extraordinary but still unusual circumstances of six hours of debate on them, giving Members the opportunity to have their say. We have listened, and we are listening to the House, and indeed to the country more widely, to ensure that we get to the right place in what is an absolute tragedy, not just for the victims but also for the political process itself.
