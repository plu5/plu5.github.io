I want to become a Godot contributor. I have no idea what I'm getting into, whether it will be over my head, and whether they would welcome my contributions or there are requirements I would not be able to meet. But nevertheless, I thought it would be interesting to document my attempts. Starting from scratch—I am not familiar with the codebase—so if you have come into this hoping to glean some insight from someone who knows what they are doing, I'm sorry!

Publishing this is going against my nature. The main worry I have right now is that I would pollute search results about Godot technical subjects with ignorant ramblings, and waste people's time. Maybe there is a way to indicate this section of my site should not be indexed.

Let's begin. Starting with going over the docs and codebase. Some repositories document the hierarchy of the codebase, maybe Godot has something like this, which could be a handy starting point?
