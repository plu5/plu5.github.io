My initials are CK. I am a programmer with particular interest in games and medicine.

I am presently working on:
- Maintaining [`retype`](https://github.com/plu5/retype), [`Eisenhour`](https://github.com/plu5/eisenhour), and my mods
- Publishing old projects
- Developing some new ideas (a profile tracker for Steam, an open-source surgery game, a Wikipedia progression tracker...)
- Making mods for games
- Contributing to open-source projects

[//]: # "- O Life & Death (OLND); an open-source surgery game based on the DOS game [Life & Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_%26_Death)"

More details may be found on the [projects page]({{ site.url }}) and on [GitHub](https://github.com/plu5).

I have experience with the following programming and scripting languages (most to least experienced):
- **Python**
- JavaScript
- HTML, CSS
- **C++**
- Elisp
- AutoHotkey
- Swift
- C
- C#
- Bash
- PowerShell

[//]: # "Ada, Lua"

I bolded the ones I want to focus on.
